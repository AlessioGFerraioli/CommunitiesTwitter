# CommunitiesTwitter

### Network and Communities analysis of Twitter users discussing Covid-19 vaccines in Italy.

This project was done as a collaboration between Alessio Giuseppe Ferraioli and Giancarlo Franco Cuticchia during the course of "Complex Networks" by prof. D. Remondini at the University of Bologna. 

**IMPORTANT**: this repo is currently going through reorganization of the files and the README (this file) is under construction.
